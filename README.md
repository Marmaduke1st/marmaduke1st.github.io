<h3>About Me:</h3>
I am mature student studying engneering related fields. I started last year studying a Level 3 in Advanced Manufacturing Engineering to prepare me for a degree level apprenticeship course. 
My original course choice was not what I'm currently registering onto but I'm very excited about starting a Robotics Engineer apprenticeship with my company in January.
