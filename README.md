### About Me:
I am mature student studying engneering related fields. I started last year studying a Level 3 in Advanced Manufacturing Engineering to prepare me for a degree level apprenticeship course. 
My original course choice was not what I'm currently registering onto but I'm very excited about starting a Robotics Engineer apprenticeship with my company in January.

### Projects:
- BlueTooth Relay Board Commands:
    After much investigation, I managed to find and actuate all relays.
- Pico SCPI Library:
    A work in progress but I'm working on a SCPI library for the 5000 Series PicoScope oscilloscopes.
